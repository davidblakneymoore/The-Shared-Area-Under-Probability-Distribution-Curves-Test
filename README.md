# The-Shared-Area-Under-Probability-Distribution-Curves-Test

The shared area under probability distribution curves test is a non-parametric alternative to the analysis of variance. It makes no assumptions about the data and it is not based on ranks, so information about absolute distances between data points is not lost. This repository contains R code that explains this test. A video with a detailed explanation about this test can be found at https://youtu.be/DxRXTpv2-t4.
